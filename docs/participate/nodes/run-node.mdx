# Running a Full Node (Validator)

To install and manage your own node, use the **[mytonctrl](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl)** open source tool developed by TON Foundation. The majority of TON Nodes are reliable and tested by **mytonctrl**.

## Hardware requirements

You need a machine with a **fixed IP address** and a **high-bandwidth network connection** to run a TON Blockchain Full Node. Typically you'll need a sufficiently powerful server in a data center with good network connectivity, using at least a 1 Gbit/s connection to reliably accommodate peak loads (the average load is expected to be approximately 100 Mbit/s).

Recommendations to run a Full Node:

- at least 8 cores CPU
- at least 64 GB RAM
- at least 512 GB NVMe SSD
- 1 Gbit/s network connectivity
- public IP address (_fixed IP address_)


## Installation

### Installation steps

1. Download and run the installation script. Choose your Linux distributive:


<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh -m full
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={'debian'} label={'Debian'}>

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
su root -c 'bash install.sh -m full'
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Check the **mytonctrl** installation procedure at:

* [How to become a validator with mytonctrl (v0.2, OS Ubuntu)](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/blob/master/docs/en/manual-ubuntu.md)


## Become a Validator

To become a validator:

1. Send Toncoin to your wallet.
2. **mytonctrl** automatically joins validation from the next election round.
3. Check the manual: [How to become a validator with mytonctrl (v0.2, OS Ubuntu)](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/blob/master/docs/en/manual-ubuntu.md)

:::info

To use your Full Node just as an endpoint, skip everything about the validator function. There is no need to send coins to your wallet.
